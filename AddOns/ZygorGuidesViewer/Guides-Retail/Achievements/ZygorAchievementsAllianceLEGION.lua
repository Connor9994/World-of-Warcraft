To earn this achievement, you will need to kill each of the Demonic Lieutenants summoned by the Sentinax
|tip You can either farm for the beacons to summon these yourself or wait under the Sentinax for other players to summon them.
confirm
step
If you are farming for the beacons to summon these bosses, you will need to find a Nethershard farming Sentinax group
|tip Press "I" and look in the Premade Groups, Custom section for "Sentinax" or "Shard" groups.
|tip Usually there will be a few groups active.
|tip Do not join a raid group.
confirm
stickystart "Than'otalion"
stickystart "Skulguloth"
stickystart "Force-Commander Xillious"
stickystart "An'thyna"
stickystart "Fel Obliterator"
stickystart "Illisthyndria"
step
Now that you are in a farming group, defeat enemies that come out of the portals
|tip If you get any Uncommon or Rare quality Beacons, use them to summon more enemies to kill.
|tip The Epic quailty beacons are used to summon Demonic Lieutenants.
|tip These have a small chance to drop off of any of the enemies from the other 2 types of beacons
|tip Once a Lieutenant is defeated the Sentinax will not allow you to summon any more beacons for 5 minutes.
