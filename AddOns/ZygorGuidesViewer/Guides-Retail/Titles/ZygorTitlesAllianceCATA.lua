|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability. Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again. Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability. Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again. Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

the Darkmoon Faire is to do dailies on Darkmoon Faire Island every day that the Faire is in town.

You can also earn reputation by turning in Darkmoon Decks. Click here to view the Darkmoon Deck statistics. |next "cards" |confirm

Cards may be the most expensive turnin for the Faire, but they also provide the most reputation.
The higher level of card that you turn in, the more reputation you will receive.
You will receive 350 reputation for turning in any Epic Darkmoon Decks and 25 reputation for rogues decks.
This means that without guild perks you need 109 epic decks or 1520 rogues decks to become Exalted from Friendly.

In order to get Exalted with Ravenholdt Faction, you need to grind mobs to _11,999/12,000_ Honored reputation.
Once you've reached Honored, you will need to collect a lot of Heavy Junkboxes.  If you aren't a rogue, you will need the assistance of one.
You can get a lot of Heavy Junkboxes frequently if you go to Blackrock Spire, but unless you're an engineer, it will be time consuming to run back and forth to a mailbox to clear up space.
