You will need to farm Cenarion Circle and Cenarion Expedition reputation.
Farming rep in the dungeons Slave Pens and Underbog is a good way to gain reputation up to Honored.
You can also kill naga or any mobs for Unidentified Plant Parts until friendly.
You can also grind reputation from Heroic Coilfang Instances up to Exalted if you would rather do that.
Coilfang Armaments drop in normal Steamvaults, as well as heroic Coilfang instances.

In order to get exalted with Ravenholdt Faction, you need to grind mobs to 11,999/12,000 Honored reputation.
Once you've reached Honored, you will need to collect a lot of Heavy Junkboxes.  If you aren't a rogue, you will need the assistance of one.
You can get a lot of Heavy Junkboxes frequently if you go to Blackrock Spire, but unless you're an engineer, it will be time consuming to run back and forth to a mailbox to clear up space.
You can farm Syndicate mobs at [Arathi Highlands,27.1,30.6]
Also at [Arathi Highlands,19.5,61.9]
And [Hillsbrad Foothills,57.9,25.3]

|tip You can also announce in the Trade Chat of any major city that you are willing to purchase Heavy Junkboxes in multiples of 5, whether by mail or in person for x amount of gold.
